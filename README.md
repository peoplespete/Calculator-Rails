# README

First off, thanks for the opportunity to work this code challenge.

## How to get this puppy working...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peoplespete/Calculator-Rails.git
bundle install
rails server
```

Open the browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)


## To run the tests
```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

## To find the business logic

Most of the business logic is in a helper called [CalculatorHelper](app/helpers/calculator_helper.rb).
A little more logic can be found in the [CalculatorController](app/controllers/calculator_controller.rb).

Thanks again for your time and attention!
